Emacs Folio collects Org-mode pages into "notebooks" composed of
interlinked notes. Folio aims to integrate org-mode information
management into the GNOME Desktop by using open standards like Tango,
D-Bus, and the Freedesktop specs.

* Features

** Notebooks are self-contained collections of org "pages" and other files.
** CamelCase links connect notes together. Plain org links can also be used.
** Pop-up note editing (similar to Tomboy) with global hot-keys
** Use different org setups for different projects' notebooks
** Share your notes via HTML publishing
** Color-coded icons for in-buffer org constructs (icons use Tango spec)
** D-BUS integration

* Shortcuts

Press F8 to toggle inline image display. 
Press F9 to toggle activation of CamelCase links.
