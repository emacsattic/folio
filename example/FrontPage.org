* Welcome to Folio!

EmacsFolio collects OrgMode pages into "notebooks" composed of
interlinked notes, files, and metadata. Folio aims to integrate
OrgMode information management into the GnomeDesktop by using open
standards like TangoSpecification, DeeBus, and the FreeDesktop specs.

* Features

 - Notebooks are self-contained collections of OrgPages and other files.
 - CamelCase links connect notes together. Plain org links can also be used.
 - PopUp note editing (similar to Tomboy) with global HotKeys
 - Use different org setups for different projects' notebooks
 - Share your notes via HtmlPublishing
 - Color-coded OrgIcons for in-buffer org constructs.
   The icons' color scheme follows the TangoSpecification.
 - DeeBus (i.e. D-Bus) integration for DesktopNotifications and so on.

* Shortcuts

Press F8 to toggle inline image display. 
Press F9 to toggle activation of CamelCase links.
